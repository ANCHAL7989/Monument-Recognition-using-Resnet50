# Monument-Recognition-using-Resnet50

Image Classification pipeline with the help of state-of-the-art model (ResNet based model) to classify monuments using Monument Recognition dataset. An example of transfer learning module which automates the process of identifying the monuments and to retrieve similar images for studying art forms in greater detail. It does so with the help of a PyTorch pretrained ResNet-50 model
